### Problem:
Many people have a hard time taking photos. When asked to take a photo, what pose do you strike, what should I take a photo of? This plethora of options often leaves us frozen due to overchoice. 

---

### Solution:
So, we aim to tackle this issue by providing people with specific prompts. Forcing/Motivating them to take photos or videos and create lasting memories with a fun purpose rather than just being an aimless photo taken at an arbitrary period of time.

---

### Impact:
People will have more meaningful pictures and memories to look back on rather than either looking at a blank photo library due to never having an interest in photos and only now regreting not taking any or having a library filled with meaningless photos.
